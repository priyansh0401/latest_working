# Camera Issues Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Camera Settings Page Missing** ✅
**Problem**: Clicking "Settings" button resulted in 404 error - page didn't exist
**Root Cause**: Missing route file for camera settings
**Solution**: 
- Created `/app/dashboard/cameras/[id]/settings/page.tsx`
- Full-featured settings page with form validation
- CRUD operations for camera management
- Delete functionality with confirmation

### 2. **Video.js Hotkeys Plugin Error** ✅
**Problem**: `Error: plugin "hotkeys" does not exist` when viewing camera streams
**Root Cause**: Video.js configuration included unsupported hotkeys plugin
**Solution**: 
- Removed hotkeys plugin from Video.js configuration
- Cleaned up player initialization code
- Maintained all other Video.js functionality

### 3. **Dummy Cameras in Dashboard** ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard showed hardcoded mock cameras instead of real database cameras
**Root Cause**: `useCameras` hook was returning mock data instead of API data
**Solution**: 
- Updated `useCameras` hook to fetch from `/api/cameras`
- Updated `useCamera` hook to fetch from `/api/cameras/[id]`
- Removed all mock camera data
- Dashboard now shows only real cameras from database

### 4. **Missing Camera Update API** ✅
**Problem**: No way to update camera settings (missing PUT endpoint)
**Root Cause**: API route only had GET and DELETE methods
**Solution**: 
- Added PUT method to `/api/cameras/[id]/route.ts`
- Automatic stream URL regeneration on updates
- Proper validation and error handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Camera Settings Page
```typescript
// Full-featured settings page with:
- Form validation using Zod schema
- Real-time updates to database
- Stream URL regeneration
- Delete functionality
- Error handling and user feedback
```

### Fixed Video.js Configuration
```typescript
// Removed problematic hotkeys plugin:
const player = videojs(videoRef.current, {
  // ... other config
  // plugins: { hotkeys: { ... } } // REMOVED
});
```

### Updated API Integration
```typescript
// Real API calls instead of mock data:
export function useCameras() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["cameras"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await fetch("/api/cameras");
      return response.json();
    },
  });
}
```

### Enhanced API Routes
```typescript
// Added PUT method for camera updates:
export async function PUT(req: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Validation, update logic, stream URL generation
}
```
